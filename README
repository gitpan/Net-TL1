Net/TL1 version 0.03
====================

Transaction Language 1 is a configuration interface to
network devices used in public networks. Through its very
structured but human-readable interface it is very suitable

The Net::TL1 module provides an interface to the sometimes
arcane TL1 commands and parses the output of these commands
for easy processing in scripts.
